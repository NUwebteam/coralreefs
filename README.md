Matt McDonald commented:  Email from Mark Patterson: One more bit of news I keep forgetting to mentionâ€¦.two months ago Fabien Cousteau asked me and Brian Helmuth to help him host a high profile event in the Caribbean in January reviewing the state of reefs basin-wide. Some heavy hitters are coming like Dr. Sylvia Earle, royal family from Netherlands (Aruba, Curacao, Bonaire), possibly business leaders like Richard Branson, etc. The Governor General of Bonaire as well as island nation leaders will either be in attendance or will be sending their ministers. Brian and I are chairing sessions and serving on panels. The Schmidt Foundation renewal is sending Ethan Edson with us as well as we are having a session on plastics pollution. The conference will take place 8-12 January in Bonaire. I will send more details once the agenda is finalized. I expect MARCOM will want to do something with the NEU involvement. Best Mark Mark R.
